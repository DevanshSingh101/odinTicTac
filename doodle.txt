Goal to check winner
check if there are 3 same symbols in a row
 iterate over elements in each row starting from 1 and go to 2
 add a same symbol counter (value = previous value ) increase similarity count by one, i.e if similarity count is 2 then we have a winner

 now the sim logic for columns


functionality to add - 

game reset
start game only when clicked on start
when cell is clicked update p.innerhtml and update gameboard


When I click the grid I want two things to happen -
  
  update gameboard
  the turn should change and stay there until it another board is clicked

  update symbol 
    symbol should be player whose turn it is

how do I make turns?
